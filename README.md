# IPL-Project-Assignment
Python: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Use Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly) to perform IPL insights and visual storytelling:
Combine and clean the relevant datasets
Analyze run trends over the years
Compare batting styles (anchor vs aggressive) via strike rate and boundary %
Study bowling consistency (dot balls, economy rate, average)
Visualize performance in different overs (Powerplay, Death)
Compare venue behavior in high-scoring vs low-scoring matches
